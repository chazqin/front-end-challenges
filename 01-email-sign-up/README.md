# Email Sign Up Form

Challenge Info: https://piccalil.li/blog/challenge-001-email-sign-up-form/

## Built With

Vanilla - HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Things Learnt

- CSS Normalize Vs. CSS Reset: used a combination of Normalize.css and a customized reset targeting only a few elements.

- Centering in CSS: used 'position: absolute' and 'transform'.

- CSS Architecture: used a combination of SMACSS and SUITCSS. CSS file sectioning: base, layout, component, utility. CSS selector naming: u-utilityName, componentName[--modifierName|-descendantName].

  (Using this architecture seems overkill for this "one-component" UI pattern as the css selectors became verbose.)

## Look Into Next

- Accessibility concepts and techniques

- Consistent spacing metrics for paddings, margins in CSS.
